# Open Stage Control template for Bitwig
You can use any device that has google chrome, to remotely control Bitwig studio.
On an iPad I recommend using an app called FullScreen Browser for a full screen experience

## Dependencies
- [DrivenByMoss](https://github.com/git-moss/DrivenByMoss/):
An  Bitwig extension that communicates with the Bitwig  api to send and receive OSC messages. Follow the instructions to setup and add an OSC controller in Bitwig controllers.

- [Open Stage Control](https://openstagecontrol.ammd.net/): a web application that allows you to build and run templates that send OSC commands to Bitwig
