# Open Stage Control template for Bitwig
A modified and restyled version of the template provided by Jurgen in his DrivenByMoss OSC extension.
You can use any device that has a web browser, to remotely control Bitwig studio.
On an iPad I recommend using an app called FullScreen Browser for a full screen experience

## Dependencies
